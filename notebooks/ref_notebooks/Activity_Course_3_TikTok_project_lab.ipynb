    "Your TikTok data team is still in the early stages of their latest project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize the TikTok dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orion Rainier, a Data Scientist at TikTok, is pleased with the work you have already completed and is requesting your assistance with some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization. The management team asked to see a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help us understand the data. At the very least, include a graph comparing claim counts to opinion counts, as well as boxplots of the most important variables (like “video duration,” “video like count,” “video comment count,” and “video view count”) to check for outliers. Also, include a breakdown of “author ban status” counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. Tableau visualizations are particularly helpful in status reports to the client and board members. For this data, create a Tableau dashboard showing a simple claims versus opinions count, as well as stacked bar charts of claims versus opinions for variables like video view counts, video like counts, video share counts, and video download counts. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isn’t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director is a person with visual impairments.\n",

    "\n",
    "When building predictive models, the presence of outliers can be problematic. For example, if you were trying to predict the view count of a particular video, videos with extremely high view counts might introduce bias to a model. Also, some outliers might indicate problems with how data was captured or recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate objective of the TikTok project is to build a model that predicts whether a video is a claim or opinion. The analysis you've performed indicates that a video's engagement level is strongly correlated with its claim status. There's no reason to believe that any of the values in the TikTok data are erroneously captured, and they align with expectation of how social media works: a very small proportion of videos get super high engagement levels. That's the nature of viral content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it's good practice to get a sense of just how many of your data points could be considered outliers. The definition of an outlier can change based on the details of your project, and it helps to have domain expertise to decide a threshold. You've learned that a common way to determine outliers in a normal distribution is to calculate the interquartile range (IQR) and set a threshold that is 1.5 * IQR above the 3rd quartile.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this TikTok dataset, the values for the count variables are not normally distributed. They are heavily skewed to the right. One way of modifying the outlier threshold is by calculating the **median** value for each variable and then adding 1.5 * IQR. This results in a threshold that is, in this case, much lower than it would be if you used the 3rd quartile.\n",
